OL,7, For much of the film the audience is   
OL,8, engaged in the familiar game of spot

OL,7, Bearing in mind what has happened to   
OL,8, theBSpice GirlsGlately, the script is  
OL,9, sometimes surprisingly prescient.      
OL,11, Our heroines wonder whether their fame 
OL,12, will all be over soon, and the delayed 
OL,13, start of a concert causes an audience  
OL,14, to grow impatient with them.           
OL,16, But, you may be asking, can any of them
OL,17, act? Who knows? And who cares? They    
OL,18, sing a lot, dance a bit, crack the odd 
OL,19, joke and look cute while doing it,     
OL,20, which is really what they are about.
