OL,12,BPryce,Gnuttier than any fruitcake, now 
OL,13, wants exclusive rights to saturate     
OL,14, China with his satellite TV as well.   
OL,16, World domination, no less, is what he's
OL,17, after. Who does he think he is ` Rupert
OL,18, Murdoch? Anyway, to achieve his ends he
OL,19, starts a war between China and Britain.
OL,20, And, of course, only 007 can stop him.

OL,7, Storywise, it may be a load of old     
OL,8, cobblers, but the film is boisterously 
OL,9, directed and highly enjoyable.         
OL,11,BPierce BrosnanGhas grown impressively  
OL,12, into the role, lending it the subtle   
OL,13, gravitas it has lacked since the days

OL,7, The deceased body count in this romp   
OL,8, is astronomical, while the seduced body
OL,9, count stands at three.                 
OL,11, It's all quite satisfactory really but 
OL,12, although it pains me to say this,      
OL,13,BJonathan PryceG` superb actor that he  
OL,14, is ` simply isn't menacing enough to be
OL,15, a Bond villain.                        
OL,17, I've never met real-life media tycoons 
OL,18, Murdoch or Turner, but I reckon they're
OL,19, more terrifying than Pryce and they    
OL,20, don't even have to declare war on China
